- 2025-01-07 RefModel-v4.zip:
	Stages model folder that contains a references model based on
	ECSS-Q-ST-80C and ECSS-E-ST-40C. Note, this model requires a
	running Stages instance. In case you don't have Stages at your
	disposal, there is a linearized PDF version of this reference
	model.

- 2025-01-07 RefModel-v4.pdf:
	A PDF printout of the reference model. This file can be viewed
	by everyone without having the need to have a Stages instance
	running.

- 2025-01-07 MetricBasedQAPlan.zip:
	This Stages model folder is specifically equipped with a version
	of Feature-driven development that is assigned to different metrics.
	The metrics assigned to the different FDD steps are grounded in 
	the ANuKI Metric Management Tool and their assignment is computed
	using historical (artificial) data. This model project thus serves
	the demonstration of linking certain process steps with data to
	help project and quality managers decide/select proper metrics to
	run the project's quality assurance.

- 2025-01-07 DynComplTailoring.zip:
	This Stages model folder contains a modified Stages model that
	outlines a dynamic tailoring approach based on the current project 
	status. The tailoring is meant to reflect the project's status and
	to derive an action plan from the open/remaining activities so that
	the compliance with a given standard is fulfilled. The standard of
	interest also define the baseline for the actual activity plan
	generation
